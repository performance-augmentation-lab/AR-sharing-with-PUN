# AR Content Sharing with Photon Unity Networking (PUN, aka 'Photonengine').

In this demo of PUN, indoor positions of users are shared between clients, using the title page of the Annual Report 2018 of the Performance Augmentation Lab as a image target to syndicate: https://pal.cct.brookes.ac.uk/publications/annual-report-2018/

Compile for Hololens / Android, run both apps simulataneously and point at the market to syndicate.
